# Laravel Grafana
A simple docker-compose workflow to set up a LEMP stack with Grafana, Prometheus and Loki docker containers. Creating this project for monitoring application performance of a Laravel application using Grafana, Prometheus and Loki.

## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repository.

From the project's root directory run `docker-compose up -d --build`. Open up your browser of choice to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see your Laravel app is running. 

We have added three more container that handle Composer, NPM, and Artisan commands without having to have these platforms installed on your local computer. Use the following command templates from your project root:

- `docker-compose run --rm composer install`
- `docker-compose run --rm npm run dev`
- `docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate:refresh --seed` 

The created container and their ports (if used) are as follows:

- **nginx** - `:8080`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **php** - `:9000`
- **npm**
- **composer**
- **artisan**
- **grafana** - `:3000`
- **loki** - `:3100`

## Persistent MySQL Storage

By default, whenever you down the docker-compose network, your MySQL data will be removed as the containers are destroyed. If you would like to have your data after bringing containers up, do the following:

1. Create a `mysql` folder in the project root, alongside the `nginx` and `src` folders.
2. Under the mysql service in your `docker-compose.yml` file, add the following lines:

```
volumes:
  - ./.docker/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```
